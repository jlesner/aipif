<lesson>All warfare is based on deception.</lesson>
<lesson>If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.</lesson>
<lesson>If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.</lesson>
<lesson>If his forces are united, separate them.</lesson>
<lesson>Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.</lesson>
<lesson>He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.</lesson>
<lesson>He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.</lesson>
<lesson>He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.</lesson>
<lesson>He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.</lesson>
<lesson>He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.</lesson>
<lesson>In war, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.</lesson>
<lesson>Know thyself and know thy enemy; in a hundred battles, you will never be defeated.</lesson>
<lesson>When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal.</lesson>
<lesson>If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are sure to be defeated in every battle.</lesson>
<lesson>The skillful warrior avoids the battle.</lesson>
<lesson>The ultimate excellence is breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.</lesson>
<lesson>Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without even having to fight.</lesson>
<lesson>For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill.</lesson>
<lesson>To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.</lesson>
<lesson>If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.</lesson>
<lesson>To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.</lesson>
<lesson>Thus, the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.</lesson>
<lesson>Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.</lesson>
<lesson>Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.</lesson>
<lesson>Speed is the essence of war.</lesson>
<lesson>Swift as the wind; quiet as the forest; conquer like the fire; steady as the mountain.</lesson>
<lesson>Use the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.</lesson>
<lesson>There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare.</lesson>
<lesson>Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.</lesson>
<lesson>He who wishes to fight must first count the cost.</lesson>
<lesson>He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious.</lesson>

<lesson>There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: recklessness, cowardice, hasty temper, delicacy of honor, and over-solicitude for his men.</lesson>

<lesson>When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.</lesson>
<lesson>Move swift as the wind and closely-formed as the wood; attack like the fire and be still as the mountain.</lesson>
