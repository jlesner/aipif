Show, Don't Tell: When possible reveal information using dialoge do not state it directly. If a specific aspect is important, reveal it using dialoge between characters. For example, if a character is sad, do not say &quot;The character was sad.&quot;  Instead, have another character ask &quot;Why are you sad?&quot; This will allow audience to infer the character is sad without being told directly.
Economy of Words: Be concise. You don't need long, poetic descriptions. Every word should serve the purpose of conveying essential visual or auditory information, setting the mood, or advancing the story.
Clarity is Key: While you don't want to be overly verbose, you do want to be clear. Children reading should have a good understanding action and how it relates to the entire story.
