# AI Personalized Interactive Fiction
## Team

Luke / Tony / Jasmine / Poom

## Overview

AI personalized “choose your way” adventures (words + pictures + music + sounds) for children four to eight years old.

## How it works
1. Pick things your child likes.
2. Review / edit / approve the generated “Choose your way” adventure.
3. “Educate your child while they are entertained.”

## Theme

AI as a teacher through interactive fiction.

## Novelty

* Countless storylines can be generated and combined allowing parents pick ones that will best entertain and educate their child. 
* AI crafted stories can explore unique topics that writers have not yet thought about. 
* Personalized interactive fiction lets a child practice making decisions and see consequences.

## Value

“Interactive stories about your child’s favorite things personalized for the things you wish to teach your child.”

Entertain your child
* Child’s favorite characters, toys, foods
* Child’s favorite music and sounds

Educate your child
* Morals / street smarts / academics / what if..
* Common mistakes (watch out!)

## Technology
* Generative Artificial Neural Networks
* Stable Diffusion: Pictures / Music / Sounds
* Large Language Models (LLMs)
